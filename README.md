## README

This repo was created as part of the class project for 
the [The Data Scientist's Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/course/datascitoolbox)
course at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

Since this is the first course, and mostly about setup,
this part of the project is just to create 
a basically empty repo.
Well not a completely empty repo,
but one with a single [HelloWorld.md](HelloWorld.md)
file in it.

Unless the subsequent classes use the same repo,
this repo is unlikely to get very interesting.
